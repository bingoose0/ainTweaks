# ainTweaks
### Warning: This project will not be updated as much anymore. I will attempt to keep up with new minecraft versions. You may fork this and keep it updated if you like.  
### My only request is that this is kept open-source, including any forks. 


ainTweaks add various new items to the game, as well as tweaks many things.  

ainTweaks also features an extendable food library, so that you may add what you like.
